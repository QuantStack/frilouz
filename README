A tiny wrapper compatible with ``ast.parse`` from the builtin ``ast`` module and
``gast.parse`` from the great ``gast`` package.

If the input code doesn't have any syntax error, it just forwards the call to
the wrapped call. Otherwise it removes part of the input code and goes on with
the parsing, collecting the syntax errors met on the go.
